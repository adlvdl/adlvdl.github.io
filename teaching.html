		<h1>Teaching</h1>
		I have always enjoyed teaching and have often volunteered as a teaching asssitant and to cover lectures when the professor was not available.
		Below I list some of the courses I have assisted on.
		
		<h2>University of Sheffield</h2>
		This year I am involved in the Data analysis, designing usable webpages, Database design and Data mining and visualization postgraduate modules.
		I have assisted Prof. Val Gillet on the chemoinformatics module, where the basics of our disciplines is taught to first year chemistry undergraduates.
		I have also assisted Prof. Peter Stordy in the module "Designing better websites", where masters students are introduced to HTML5 and CSS.
		
		<h2>University of Bonn</h2>
		During my PhD I helped as a teaching assistant in several courses organized by my supervisor, Prof. Jürgen Bajorath. Among them, I helped in the "Chemoinformatics practical", where masters students learned the Java language through chemoinformatics focused exercises.
		Another programming course I helped with was "Programming lab 2", this one focused on Python.
		Additionally, I helped in the course "Molecular modeling and drug design", where masters students perform modeling exercises suing the software MOE.
		I also gave some lectures for the courses "Chemistry bridging course", "Bioinformatics 2" and "Chemoinformatics".
		Finally, I helped as a master student Junior-Prof. Alexander Markowetz by directing the practical part of "Foundations of information management" about relational databases.
