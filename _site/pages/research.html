<p>Chemical databases such as ChEMBL and Pubchem have been growing at an increasing pace.
Combined, they offer millions of activity measures across hundreds of protein targets and cellular assays.
In order to better analyze this wealth of information, advanced visualizations are needed.
A large part of my research at the University of Bonn was dedicated towards the design of novel visualizations for chemical data.</p>

<p>I developed a technique based on radial coordinates to study multi-target data sets.
The compounds are positioned in a three-dimensional sphere based on their similarity to other compounds and their activity against the different targets studied.</p>
