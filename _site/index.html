<p>I am a chemoinformatician, currently working as a Marie Curie fellow at the University of Sheffield for the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/d3i4adiapp/">D3i4AD</a> (Diagnostic and Drug Discovery Initiative for Alzheimer’s Disease) project. 
I hold a Biology degree (<em>Licenciatura</em>) from the Complutense University in Madrid and I attended the Life Science Informatics Masters in the University of Bonn.
I also did my PhD in the University of Bonn, under the tutelage of Prof. Dr. Jurgen Bajorath.
My current work is done under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Beining Chan and Prof. Dr. Val Gillet at the Information School in the University of Sheffield.
I am developing machine learning methods to aid in phenotypic screening that will be carried out by other members of the project. 
I will also design and search public databases for molecules that inhibit the interaction between the prion protein and amyloid-beta oligomers.</p>

A list of publications and other scientific content I have been involved with can be found <a href="/pages/publications.html">here</a>.
My curriculum vitae can be found here.</p>
